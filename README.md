# Soft Grey Theme

**Soft Grey Theme** is a dynamic UI colour theme for Visual Studio Code. Based on the Atom One Dark/Light theme it follows the same syntax highlighting design language, but sets different accent colours. Colours are choosen from a grey colour palette rather than the blue grey palette of Atom.
